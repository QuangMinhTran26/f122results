Hello everyone, this is my first ever project using HTML and CSS. For this site i also use Bootstrap v4.1.3 as well as jQuerry and Popper.js. The site is inspired by "Museum Of Candy" by Colt Steele and the pictures i found on the subreddit r/f1porn. Please feel free to provide any feedback, i am more than happy to hear them.

As an avid Formula One and Ferrari fan, i put my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript to good use and created this site.
For that reason, this website serves the purpose of showcasing results of every Formula One race in 2022.
The first sentence is legendary commentator David Croft's famous buzzwords before the start of each race.
The name of the Grand Prix as well as date, time, circut and three drivers finishing first, second, and third can be found in each section.
In the end, the three drivers with the most amount of points scored and the three constructors finishing the highest are also listed.

Features of this site: 
- Responsive website for different devices
- Navigation bar includes clickbale buttons: Official Website leads to the official webiste of Formula 1, Videos leads to the Youtube video library of the latest season, About leads to the site description
- There is special effect when hovering on each clickable headlines
- The highlight of each race can be found on each track's name
